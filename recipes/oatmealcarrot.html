    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>180g of all-purpose flour (中力粉)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of ginger</li> 
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>240g of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>225g of brown sugar</li>
        <li>100g of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>20g of dark molasses (optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>165g of freshly grated peeled carrots</li>
        <li>270g of old-fashioned whole rolled oats</li>
    
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or stand mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. </li>   
        <li>Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. </li>   
        <li>Add the eggs, molasses (if using), vanilla extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined.</li>   
        <li> With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the carrots and oats.</li>   
            The dough will be thick and sticky.
        <li>Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (and up to 4 days). </li>   
            If chilling for more than 3 hours, allow to sit at room temp for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C (160 if using a convection oven).
            Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Scoop balls of dough, about 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie and place 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart on the baking sheets.
            Bake for 13 to 14 minutes, or until lightly browned on the sides. 
            The centers will look a little soft.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheets for 5 mintues before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
