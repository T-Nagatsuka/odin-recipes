    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>270g of all-purpose flour (中力粉)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>120g of unsalted butter, softened to room temp</li>
        <li>95g of vegetable shortening, room temp</li>
        <li>225g of brown sugar</li>
        <li>200g of granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>325g of creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or stand mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. </li>   
        <li>Add the brown sugar and 100 grams of the granulated sugar, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. </li>   
        <li>Add the eggs and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and peanut butter and beat on medium-high speed until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined.</li>   
        <li>Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (and up to 4 days). </li>   
            If chilling for more than 3 hours, allow to sit at room temp for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C (160 if using a convection oven).
            Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Scoop balls of dough, about 1 tablespoon of dough per cookie, then roll each in the remaining 100 grams of granulated sugar to coat.
            Place the dough balls 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart on the baking sheets.
            Press a fork into the tops to create the crisscross pattern.

        <li> Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until lightly browned on the sides. 
            The centers will look a little soft.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheets for 5 mintues before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
